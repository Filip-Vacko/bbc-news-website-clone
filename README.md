# bbc-news-website-clone
Clone of the [BBC Tech News Website](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology) created with HTML and CSS only. Made for the purpose of practicing my skills.

I use just plain CSS, coding it "by hand" and not using any framework, library or tool. 

## Compatibility & issues

Tested in Chrome only. 

The design is not responsive and is suited for a resolution of 1024 x 768. 

Apart from the design not being responsive, the clone is not 100% faithful to the original BBC News website in some small details. One example of an inaccuracy is the missing BBC Reith font. The reason for this is that according to the [Terms and Conditions on the BBC site](https://www.bbc.co.uk/branding), it's not possible to use the font legally, unless I somehow work for the BBC.

## Things I'm going to try fixing
Properly change color of the headline of a visited article - for some reason, I couldn't get it working.
